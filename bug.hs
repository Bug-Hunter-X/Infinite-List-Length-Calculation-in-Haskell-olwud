This Haskell code attempts to use the `length` function on an infinite list, which results in a non-terminating computation.  The program will run indefinitely without producing any output.

```haskell
import Prelude

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let infiniteList = [1..]  -- Infinite list of integers
  let listLength = length infiniteList
  print listLength
```
